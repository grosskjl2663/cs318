                Mississippi, oh, Mississippi,<br>
                timeless beauty,<br>
                you have carried countless stories<br>
                without judgement.<br>
                Your serene wisdom<br>
                inspires curiosity in young and old.<br>
                Today,<br>
                I sit before you as he asks for my hand,<br>
                how can I not accept such a kind-hearted man to be mine?<br>
                When his West melts into my East,<br>
                we become stronger as one.<br>
                Mississippi, oh, Mississippi,<br>
                you have done it again,<br>
                witnessing a new history<br>
                with prudence.<br>
                Watching your heartbeat,<br>
                in front of<br>
                “A Simpler Time”<br>
                overlooking the Julia Belle Swain,<br>
                I think of Mother.<br>
                Back then,<br>
                she once sat before the Mekong,<br>
                10,000 miles away.<br>
                Death asking for her hand,<br>
                how can she accept to go at such a young age?<br>
                When escaping certain death becomes a second chance,<br>
                she grows stronger with others.<br>
                Mekong, oh, Mekong,<br>
                you have done it again,<br>
                witnessing a new history<br>
                with prudence.<br>
                Watching your heartbeat,<br>
                in front of<br>
                fear<br>
                overlooking “The Land of Smiles.”<br>
                She thinks of her future.<br>
                <br>
                Two daughters<br>
                before<br>
                two rivers.<br>
                Each with hopes and dreams,<br>
                like the moon and the sun<br>
                intertwining as one.<br>
                Mekong, oh, Mekong.<br>
                Mississippi, oh, Mississippi.<br>
                Two daughters<br>
                standing before the shores of the past,<br>
                the crossroads of the present<br>
                by two rivers.

                <p><h2>MO</h2>
                Mo,
                who is Mo?
                Perhaps a brunette
                or
                a blond,
                who loves to run.
                Mo,
                on the front of a white letter jacket,
                fits crisp against my black ponytail.
                Monogramed Mo,
                track shoe wings, yellow timberwolf,
                traces of another girl.
                Mo,
                her kind mother
                gives a piece of Mo to me.
                A daughter from another mother,
                who wants to run like her Mo.
                Running season is over,
                proudly I wear Mo.
                Watching frozen ice on the Mississippi
                with a boy,
                I see silhouettes of Mo
                walking towards me.
                My hand covers monogramed Mo.
                Black hair girl cannot be Mo.
                Feeling embarrassed for wearing Mo,
                I hide behind the boy as 
                shadows pass by.
                My shame evaporates,
                slowly.
                Mo and I,
                two daughters loved by 
                a mom, teacher, believer.
                The white letter jacket,
                our shared casing,
                one day
                metamorphosizing into butterflies.
                Still,
                the frozen ice on 
                the Mississippi
                stirs a deep longing of when.
                When 
                will I be my own Mo?
                Mo,
                who is Mo?
                Me,
                who am I?
                <br>

                <p><h2>Woman</h2>
                A woman’s unruffled face 
                reflects on
                the pond’s surface
                at the Friendship Garden.
                She feels braver
                after taking down her curtain of insecurity,
                then 
                adorning her skin in a comfortable robe 
                of self acceptance.
                She breaks away 
                from the chains of life
                where dreams are possible.
                She gives herself 
                wings to fly
                like fireflies on moon dust nights.
                She speaks up
                even when her voice shakes,
                stands tall
                before criticism.
                She loves wholeheartedly, 
                camouflages melancholy
                like a magenta raven in flight.
                She rediscovers beauty,
                worth, 
                like a long lost friend.
                She bonds amicably
                with those who love her,
                no strings attached.
                She learns compassion,
                loving her inner self,
                children, 
                nature,
                imperfections.
                She grows richly inside,
                reclaiming a new identity.
                A woman’s unruffled face 
                reflects on
                a pond’s surface
                at the Friendship Garden.
                Is that my face 
                 reflecting back?
                So much lies beneath the surface.

                <p><h2>Culture</h2>
                Culture
                was once hazy like a darkening sky on the western front,
                thin ominous clouds passing over. 
                Now, 
                I stand at an intersection 
                of the past and the present, 
                heart racing to find meaning, 
                purpose, 
                a place to belong. 
                Bit by bit, 
                I flourish, 
                springing up from the hard-packed earth.
                Sheltered life breaks free,
                a quiet girl grows wings with hopes and dreams.
                My mother tongue rusty with neglect.
                Language 
                speaks to the fibers bury generations deep within me.
                I am meant
                to make my world kinder,
                to continue culture.
                I build a home within myself,
                not without loving hands, 
                blood,
                tears of those who came before. 
                I remember comfort.
                Mother’s sweet rice with green mustard,
                Father’s fried fish and sticky rice,
                the intoxication of delightful smells
                 enveloping every wall with familiarity.
                I see contentment in
                wearing white pleated skirt, 
                black velvet jacket, 
                rooster crown hat,
                French coins dancing blithely during
                New Year celebrations.
                Coming full circle
                by having my children,
                I acknowledge culture.
                Being together without having to explain,
                a silent gift for who we are as mortals.
                Culture,
                 rich like words,
                scrumptious like nourishment,
                bold like garments,
                withstanding the test of time.
                Yet,
                 I had to learn to receive these 
                lasting ancestral gifts.
                Today,
                culture
                is no longer hazy,
                but like sunshine blooming upon the eastern horizon.<br>
