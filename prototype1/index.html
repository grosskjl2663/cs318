        <h1>Biography</h1>
            <img src="Images/Biography.jpg">
            <p>I grew up in Ban Vinai and Phanat Nikhom refugee camps in Thailand (Loei Province) during the 1980s and early 1990s. As children, we were often spared from the harsh and often miserable realities of poverty, early marriage, and the day-to-day survival decisions that our parents had to make. In the camps, we were free to frolic in the rain, sticking our tongues out to taste the cool droplets as they kissed our dusty bodies. Life was simple for the young and arduous for those old enough to remember their war-torn lives. Adults lost everything precious to their way of life, and in their sorrowful hearts, they would never see their old homes or be with the same relatives again.</p>
            <p>My art and writing are often inspired by childhood memories or issues that impact my culture and heritage. I am deeply fascinated by the beauty and the challenges that daughters endured in order to be “worthy” in the eyes of their families. Specifically, there is a stigma that passivity and obedience are paramount behaviors that Hmong daughters should exhibit. The reality is that all daughters have hopes and dreams and they deserve to be honored. Daughters are valuable and worthy in this world too.</p>
            <p>Growing up, I recall vividly having a younger sibling strapped to my back with a Hmong baby carrier so my parents could focus on making their crafts to sell. It was through sewing story cloths and making jewelry that my parents were able to put food on the table and keep us clothed. We did not have modern conveniences like electricity or running water. My mother sewed by a kerosene lamp at night, and I watched her body cast shadows on the thin bamboo walls when she moved her arms. Every night, we ventured out to the nearby woods and gathered a basketful of dry logs for cooking. There was a strange simplicity to this way of life, but it was never easy. Mother and I stood in long lines with our pails as we waited to fill them with water. We boiled the water for drinking and cooking, otherwise we would have terrible stomach aches from the unclean water. Women and daughters took care of everything in the household and childrearing, and yet, they lived as second class citizens.</p>
            <p>One of my greatest desires in life is to help children go to school in Southeast Asia and give them hope, so they can break away from the cycle of oppression and poverty. My life could have been different if not for my parents who brought us to this magnificent country. Education gave us a chance to a better life and every child deserves to go to school. It is our duty and responsibility to make sure they have a right to know how to read and write. I am grateful to have this opportunity to share my art and writing with you.  Follow your dreams, do your best, be kind, and your spirit will soar with happiness. Feel free to contact me with your thoughts, questions or ideas.</p>
