                <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
                <p>“Er-er-Er-ERRRR! Er-er-Er-ERRRR! Er-er-Er-ERRRR!” The distinct crow of a powerful rooster breaks through the stillness in a village. A sliver of moon peeks through thin clouds above Lao Kai’s crown when he jumps awake from a sudden disturbance. The morning air is crisp, clean, and refreshing high in the mountains. His needle-sharp talons grasp firmly onto an old tree stump as the onset of morning approaches.
Upon hearing Papa’s daily morning crows, Lao Kai feels a deep happiness and reassurance knowing the familiarity of life in his village. For a second, he sees himself like Papa as a Village Rooster, but the idea disappears quickly. It is too much of a responsibility for him to carry on his young shoulders. Feeling a bit chilled by his own thoughts, Lao Kai looks at the chicken house. He sees Papa standing proudly erect like a tree, holding his head high to give another waking call to villagers and Yer Shao’s creatures for a new day to begin.

                    <h3 class="poemtitle">Woman</h3>
                    <pre>A woman’s unruffled face 
reflects on
the pond’s surface
at the Friendship Garden.
She feels braver
after taking down her curtain of insecurity,
then 
adorning her skin in a comfortable robe 
of self acceptance.
She breaks away 
from the chains of life
where dreams are possible.
She gives herself 
wings to fly
like fireflies on moon dust nights.
She speaks up
even when her voice shakes,
stands tall
before criticism.
She loves wholeheartedly, 
camouflages melancholy
like a magenta raven in flight.
She rediscovers beauty,
worth, 
like a long lost friend.
She bonds amicably
with those who love her,
no strings attached.
She learns compassion,
loving her inner self,
children, 
nature,
imperfections.
She grows richly inside,
reclaiming a new identity.
A woman’s unruffled face 
reflects on
a pond’s surface
at the Friendship Garden.
Is that my face 
reflecting back?
So much lies beneath the surface.

                    <h3 class="poemtitle">Culture</h3>
                    <pre>Culture
was once hazy like a darkening sky on the western front,
thin ominous clouds passing over. 
Now, 
I stand at an intersection 
of the past and the present, 
heart racing to find meaning, 
purpose, 
a place to belong. 
Bit by bit, 
I flourish, 
springing up from the hard-packed earth.
Sheltered life breaks free,
a quiet girl grows wings with hopes and dreams.
My mother tongue rusty with neglect.
Language 
speaks to the fibers bury generations deep within me.
I am meant
to make my world kinder,
to continue culture.
I build a home within myself,
not without loving hands, 
blood,
tears of those who came before. 
I remember comfort.
Mother’s sweet rice with green mustard,
Father’s fried fish and sticky rice,
the intoxication of delightful smells
 enveloping every wall with familiarity.
I see contentment in
wearing white pleated skirt, 
black velvet jacket, 
rooster crown hat,
French coins dancing blithely during
New Year celebrations.
Coming full circle
by having my children,
I acknowledge culture.
Being together without having to explain,
a silent gift for who we are as mortals.
Culture,
 rich like words,
scrumptious like nourishment,
bold like garments,
withstanding the test of time.
Yet,
 I had to learn to receive these 
lasting ancestral gifts.
Today,
culture
is no longer hazy,
but like sunshine blooming upon the eastern horizon.<br>
